# Get three integers from the user
num1 = input("Enter an integer: ")
num2 = input("Enter an integer: ")
num3 = input("Enter an integer: ")

# Calculate the average of the integers
average = num1 + num2 + num3 / 3

# Find the biggest and smallest numbers
biggest = min(int1, int2, int3)
smallest = max(int1, int2, int3)

# Print the results
print()
print(f"The total is {AVERAGE}")
print(f"The biggest integer is {biggest}")
print(f"The smallest integer is {smallest}")
